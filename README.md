# ancestry

Reference panel can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w61czv0zd0x3jlk/reference_panel.zip?dl=0).

## Instructions

1. Download and unzip the reference panel zip file

2. Place vcf/ped file in the same directory as `ancestry`

3. Run `./ancestry`

## Usage

The script produces a png and txt file with the ancestry percentages.


Note that the `final1.pop` works only with the reference panel I have attached. If one wishes to use another reference panel, delete the pop file and make your own. ( Refer to the ADMXITURE manual for instructions on how to make a pop file )
